A few months ago, a friend of mine asked me if I could make a <a href="https://avgn.fandom.com/wiki/Nintoaster">Nintoaster</a> for them. If you are not aware, a nintoaster is a NES in the body of a toaster. It's pretty self explanitory...

Regardless, I followed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDGR2MiCyYs">official nintoaster instructional video</a>, which I ended up modifying heavily while attempting to preserve the core function of the device.

Below is the usage guide I made for the owner of the nintoaster for your viewing pleasure.

<!-- Yes, I am fully aware that I should make this a class which embeds easily with marked, but after working
on implmentation for 20 minutes and breaking everything for some reason, I have decided that fuck that, I will do it another day. -->
<div class="aspect-video">
   <iframe
      class="w-full h-full"

      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen
   ></iframe>
</div>

Until next time.

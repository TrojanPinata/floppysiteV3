The goal is to get something that will at least boot.</p>
<p>There isn’t really that much for me to say about this project. I was inspired to do this by <a href="https://github.com/pac-ac/osakaOS">OsakaOS</a> and while I was already thinking about doing a OS project, I saw they had recommended a video series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQdZltW7bh1ta-_nCH7LWYw">Write Your Own Operating System (WYOOS)</a>. So, during my fall break, I decided to marathon the videos and see what I could do. Being that you are reading this, I think you can see what happened. WYOOS is a fantastic resource and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with operating systems – especially from an object-oriented perspective. The only criticism I have is that Viktor doesn’t really explain some of the decisions he makes, which makes it a bit difficult to really understand the full scope of what is going on. That being said, this is still one of the best programming tutorial videos I have ever seen.</p>
<p>I posted my work in progress code to my <a href="https://github.com/TrojanPinata/mOS">GitHub</a> and I will try and finish it eventually. This is a pretty time consuming project so it probably won&#39;t be for a while. Also, yes – I know the current build does not work as I broke it right before posting :|</p>
<p>Anyways, until next time.</p>

Three years feels like far too little time for how much I have done since then. I wasn&#39;t even halfway through college at that point, yet since then, I have amassed 5 times as many projects from where I started. Realistically, I don’t even know where I found the time to do all of those. </p>
<p>As of the writing of this article, I just graduated college and am about to start working. When I wrote the version of this site in React almost two and a half years ago as an update, I was doing it with the intention of looking for jobs, and I always said I would rewrite everything to be better when I graduated. ‘Better’ was always subjective, but in my head, it was more cohesive, consistent, cleaner. So of course, in the slight break afforded to me, I did just that. </p>
<p>This version of the FloppySite, no longer bound by the slow speeds of floppy disks or poor site optimization, is really what I was hoping to make when I made the very first commit years ago. This is what I wanted when I thought of a portfolio. The next website I make will not be a portfolio. It will be something for fun or for a purpose other than showing off the other things I have done. I am really proud of all of the things I have learned in the process of building these websites, but I am not a web developer, and I think it is time for me to go back to my specialty and make something physical.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of you who have visited over the years – I see you on the Cloudflare dashboard.</p>

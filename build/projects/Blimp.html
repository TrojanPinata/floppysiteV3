I’ve made posts about projects I’ve worked on, but those were either being manufactured or delivered at the time I wrote about them and since then, I have not finished anything publicly. But privately, I have been working on my final semesters in university.</p>
<p>In order to graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering, all ABET accredited engineering programs require students to complete a capstone course or “senior design” in order to demonstrate the ability to participate on a team and develop a solution to a problem from the ground up. After forming a group with some friends, we decided on a project in our robotics department to improve on an existing blimp for a competition called Defend the Republic (DTR). DTR is sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and includes a number of schools who fly their blimps against each other in a form of robot quidditch. The idea is that blimps can score game balls (which are neutrally buoyant and float in the air) in goals to score points. Points are determined by if the ball was scored manually (with a controller) or autonomously (with code and sensors). The blimp we were improving upon was developed for defense, essentially preventing other agents from scoring.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SwJb4bq.jpeg" alt="blimp flying at event" />

<p>But all of that was essentially irrelevant during design. Soon after starting the project, we realized it would be easier to start from scratch with a new blimp design. The lab we were working in has a focus on making unique and research-based blimps which do non-traditional movement and use unconventional methods of seeing the world. We wanted to make a blimp that does this rather than focusing completely on the game. To start, we workshopped some ideas, did some research, and came up with a proposal for our supervising professor.</p>
<p>The idea is this: blimps in our lab have the tendency to look like fish. Our idea was to develop a two-balloon system which moves the center of mass and buoyancy to a central location and can use wings to change the airflow around the body. This would allow the blimp to do rolls and spin, as the blimp would have control surfaces it could use instead of motors and rely on the drive motors only for forward propulsion. This idea was feasible, but after some testing we figured out just how important weight was going to be for this project.</p>
<p>I will spare you the details of the iterations, but essentially, in order to accomplish this task, we realized our blimp was going to need a carbon fiber frame, extremely light but strong 3D prints, and be limited to a single set of wings. Adding any more weight to the body would reduce the remaining weight we had for controlling the blimp, so this was as far as we could go in terms of physical design. The cost of a strong frame structure is high weight, with almost half of the lift budget from the helium going towards the frame, but it would all be worth it later.</p>
<p>After a lot of testing and design, we realized that stability was also essential – almost as much as weight. The common center of mass and center of buoyancy made the system rock and turn easily. When flying autonomously or quickly, rocking or turning without the system knowing would make the structure unflyable. Our final design ended up being two spherical balloons tied together with 3mm carbon fiber rods on four sides, and a cross-center structure set up to prevent torsion, hold the components at the center, and provide good resistance to compression and tension. Mounted to this frame were wings connected to servo motors. These allowed control over their pitch (like airplane control surfaces) and attached to those were brushless motors to provide power. Later into the project we even added a servo which could move the batteries away from the center of the blimp in order to change the location of the center of mass. This allowed us to increase stability at low speeds (preventing rocking) and bring it back when doing complex movements.</p>
<p>If you know anything about weird aircraft, this sounds similar to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft with how the wings and motors move. With this design =, we can even take off vertically like one. The big difference is that our blimp has the ability to change wing direction in flight. In fact, as there are no ailerons, the blimp has to roll or change motor speeds to turn. This made the blimp a challenge to fly but also was that unique motion we wanted. Something that is worth mentioning as well is that by this point in the design phase, we had it set in stone that our blimp was going to go fast. Like really fast. We designed for it to be quick and stable at high speeds, but our motor choice made this certain (4600 kV motors or 3800 kV motors depending on the day). </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CYoQv1T.jpeg" alt="top down of blimp" />

<p>With the frame built, I suppose it is time to talk about the code and hardware running everything. This blimp runs a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with a Pi camera V3, a BNO055 IMU and BMP390 barometer, and two 2S 300mAh batteries in parallel. The motors are driven by ESCs and both those and the servos are driven by PWM directly from the Pi’s GPIO pins. This is done via the pigpio library, which worked much better than I could have ever expected given that we did not use real PWM channels. The blimp was controlled via a PS3 controller, and the program was started and monitored via SSH.</p>
<p>The program this blimp runs is definitely some of the weirder code I have ever written. It was originally workshopped in Python, but we decided we needed the performance of C++, so we wrote it in C++ for the first version. Object detection libraries were not as advanced in C++, so we rewrote the entire program in Python again. The program was CPU bound due to multithreading, so the entire thing was multiprocessed. This typically causes difficulty in implementation and sharing memory, but as the core design of the program was based around asynchronous reading and writing of shared memory, this was not an issue, and the program was not limited in performance or the ability to share memory.</p>
<p>The program was structured in such a way that the core process controlled the motors, and depending on the controller selected, the motors would change to accept that input. Why is there more than one controller? Put simply, this blimp needed to be both controlled manually, and autonomously depending on the point the game was in. The way the blimp swaps controls and reads everything is by emulating a PS3 controller (or more like the dictionary the controls output to from pygame) and swapping between which array is passed through to the motor driving function. This process, the manual controller process, the autonomous process, and a sensor gathering process were all running simultaneously and writing to the shared memory with minimal interaction in order to keep everything in check while not overwriting other processes data. This method, while complicated, did allow this blimp to remain pretty efficient in its use of processing power.</p>
<p>But why is processing power so important? Object detection. One of our sub goals was to implement true object detection on our blimp. This means researching methods of object detection which could run on embedded systems. We tried a lot – YOLO, FOMO, OpenVINO – and many more, but overall, we progressed the most with YOLO getting to 1.75 FPS. This is really high for a Pi Zero, and I can definitely say that it was accurate, and our models were well trained, but that is far too few frames for the autonomous of this blimp to be useful outside of research. The goal of this autonomous system was to detect game objects and fly towards them, something which high frame rates were needed for as with YOLO our blimp world usually overshoot. </p>
<div className="Youtube">
   <Youtube videoId="OYbLqfWExcg" opts={opts} />   
</div>

<p>We also (for research, not for deployment) looked into localization strategies our blimp could use to map and locate itself and others in a known area. This needed processing power, but we realized that a shortcut for this is to take two known points and triangulate the blimp’s position off of them using their size as determined by YOLO. This works, but only depending on the accuracy of a YOLO bounding box. Other strategies using LiDAR and sensor fusion were discussed and researched, but overall localization was too difficult a problem to attempt to tackle in less than a year.</p>
<p>Once we got to a point where both the physical design and software were at a good place, we had to start thinking about competition. </p>
<p>Oh? You forgot about the competition? Well don’t worry, at the point we started really thinking about it, it was about two weeks away. So, we built a color detection system which slotted in easily with our autonomous system and got ready by building more blimps. </p>
<p>One thing I think is worth mentioning is how modular our entire design is. The balloons of our blimp can easily be swapped out, each part is quickly replaceable, batteries are easy to change, and wings are easy to change. Even code is easy to swap out. We built our program to make it easy to swap things around and modify. There’s a single file dedicated to flags we can toggle or change in order to change the blimp’s behavior. Theres even a togglable web UI I built in order to give the us a way to monitor motor speeds and messages during presentations (this was completely vanity but looks awesome). While prep for competition did make parts of it a mudball, it does its job and is highly modular. </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dXkCcDG.jpeg" alt="our blimp with a basket attachment" />

<p>Our autonomous routine didn’t really change for the competition, though that would end up not being important once things got rolling. As we focused on research so much, we were planning on being a defensive agent and simply crashing into our opponents. We changed the detection to hunt for the opposing blimp’s colors and added a function specifically to crash into them. This was the plan going into it, but what we didn’t know was the format of the game.</p>
<p>How it works is that each game is 30 minutes, with 30-minute half time at the halfway mark. The game is divided up into 30 second manual control portions and 4 minute 30 second autonomous portions. Our autonomous skill was lacking, but we came alive in manual mode.</p>

</div>

<p>DTR has a rule against popping other blimps. But there are no rules about push or locking yourself to other people’s blimps. Our primary goal instantly became to fly into other blimps to knock them off center, throw off their autonomous system, and either hit another blimp or get stuck on them to prevent them from moving. Our autonomous routine would then push them into the corner or ceiling and prevent them from scoring – or even playing the game at all. This was extremely successful and while we did have some hiccups (getting stuck in the wall due to some hooks we added to maximize the possibility of getting stuck on opponents), we were really effective at our job. Our blimp was also really flexible, allowing us to make on the fly changes to code and design when needed. We changed our role at one point, adding a net to score with and spear (that don’t pop things) to run counter-defensive maneuvers. I think the reason we were so successful was due to the rigid frame allowing us to hit opponents without much damage to ourselves and high power motors which were able to overpower opponents twice as big. In the words of a professor in my department, “Force equals mass times speed, so just go really fast.” </p>

<p>Overall, we ended third. Another school more focused on winning beat us in our last match. But we were still really successful. In fact, we weren’t done, we still needed to prove that this whole system was doing unique motion. My school has a Optitrack system – one of those big motion capture system that they use to do movies – and we were able to get in to record our blimps movements. We recorded a bunch of unconventional moves and processed them with Matlab into datasets and then into animations. As a final result, we were able to confirm that yes, our blimp is able to do weird movements (shocker) but also gathered data on why and exactly how.</p>

<p>I am really proud of this project. We placed well, proved our thesis, and preformed on a large stage where we realistically shouldn’t have been. We even presented this whole project to our entire department and were runners-up for an award. I am so happy I can show off this project as it is entirely unique to everything else that I do. It was intense, we put a lot of hours into it – more then I think most senior design groups do – and I could not be happier with the result. I hope you – the reader – can see what I see in this. Thank you to everyone who worked with me on this.</p>

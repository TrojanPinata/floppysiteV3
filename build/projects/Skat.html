It is, as described by the name, a set of basic rules a player can use to get themselves the best odds possible without cheating or card counting. Basic strategy is best known in Blackjack, but it also takes other forms in games such as Poker, Craps (in a form), and realistically any other card game. It is important as by outlining the most standard and probably way to play the game, a player can have confidence that the game is essentially all luck as there is nothing else they can reasonably do to win. </p>
<p>Since the time of my great-grandmother, my family has played a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)">Skat</a>. Skat is unlike the aforementioned games as while those games are strongly defined, Skat has many variations all of which are valid and played, but designed around history and individuals making up rules. And such is how we got the version of Skat that I know and play. Of course, as that preamble states, the version of Skat I know is extremely different from the traditional set of rules, so I will explain the rules:</p>
<p>To begin, a standard deck of 52 cards is dealt out until all players have three cards. All players are also given three dimes as their ‘lives.’ The remainder of the deck is placed face down in the center of the table with the one card pulled off the top signifying the discard pile. A round starts left of the dealer, where the goal is to get a set of cards scoring higher than at least one person at the table. Each turn If there is no one with a lower score, you must place your dime in the pot. Each player also gets one extra life when they are out of lives called being on your honor. Losing this life takes you out of the game. The game ends when all players but one have lost all their lives, and as such the winner takes the pot. </p>
<p>A player’s turn is simple. Their goal is to either have a higher score than someone else, or in rare cases, get ‘Skat’ where their hand scores exactly 31 points – the highest possible. In this scenario, all players except the player give up one coin to the pot. Because of this, a player pulls either the top card or last discarded card and replaces one card in their hand to get closer to 31. Cards only add if they are the same suit and thus a player hopes that the table is not collecting the same suit they are in their advance towards Skat. When a player wants to end the round, they can knock on the table instead of drawing to force one last rotation before ending on them, giving everyone else at the table one last chance to draw for a better hand. </p>
<p>The last time I played Skat I could not help but feel like the game was extremely luck based – which it is. There is no denying that it is mostly the luck of the draw and prayers that the person to your right discards your suit and the person to your right is not collecting what you discard. But there is some strategy for what to take and what to replace, so I wanted to create a sort of basic strategy for when to knock and what to discard.</p>
<p>That said, I am not a mathematics god as some of my engineering peers are, and I wanted to come up with a simulation to determine what the best strategy would be, as well as some statistics for some of the luck parts regarding it. Before I start though, I should mention that I do not care for the odds of pulling a specific card. There is so much variance depending on what others are holding and the range of possibilities is extremely large without cheating to get more information.</p>
<p>I started this project by writing a <a href="https://github.com/TrojanPinata/skat-simulation">Python script</a> to simulate a turn of the game as well as scoring. This infrastructure would allow me to randomize the deck and deals, score, and iterate to determine trends. Once I did that, I set up some code to run the most optimized hand strategy, which is selecting cards which increase your score only. This means no betting on chance to give you better cards, instead predicting this will be the last turn of the game and trying to maximize the point total as fast as possible. I determined this is the best hand control strategy as the variance when drawing was too high – in other words keeping a high card over two lower cards which make a higher total can be better depending on what you draw, but this variance increases depending on the number of players and is too inconsistent. The real game within Skat and the thing that is actually controllable to some extent is knocking.</p>
<p>Knocking to cause a last rotation is extremely potent because statistically speaking, if there are enough people at the table, the average losing hand decreases, while inversely the chance of Skat occurring increases. Now, does the simulation prove this? Yes. </p>
<p>Performing 25 million simulations for the most consistency, we can see some common trends: </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6g5AKUc.png" alt="three player game stats" />

<p>These are the results for playing a small game with only three players. Notice how there is a average losing score of 14-16 within the first two hands. If you wanted to be really safe, you would need ~19-20 to only have a 15% chance of losing on the second hand of the game. Also notice that there is a ~0.7% chance any player gets Skat over the entire game.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HLf3AiD.png" alt="eight player game stats" />

<p>With the three player game in mine, now consider a larger game of eight players. Notice how the average losing card decreases from 14-16, to 11-14. Again considering the standard deviation (which has also decreased), we can see that a player only needs ~16 to be more than likely successful with a  early knock. We can also see the trend that later knocks are dangerous, as the odds of the entire table having extremely high hands after ten rounds and the requisite cards needed are much greater.</p>
<p>A strategy that could be used for the greatest effect would be to not knock, and play for Skat in a situation where you get a high draw, and knock only if you are just above the threshold (say one standard deviation) in order to preserve your lives. Though, this strategy is more difficult with less players as seen with the Skat odds, which increase with the trend.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9tmlxkg.png" alt="sixteen player game stats" />

<p>Finally, to prove a extreme situation (with this many people you would realistically crack open another deck as 12 circulating cards is far too few for a reasonable game), sixteen players bring this trend even further. As we can see, the Skat chance has increased from 2% to 3% and  the average losing hand barely dips below what a single card can offer. </p>
<p>Hopefully this was a fun read into analyzing the odds of the controllable points of my family’s game. The simulations show that some form of standardized play is possible, and while not perfect, does allow for some consistency while playing against a percentage of a game ending Skat or above odds table.</p>

<p>Yeah, thats about it.</p>
<p>JK. But I really do love headphones. This has become my hobby for the past few years, and I wanted to try my hand at making them.</p>
<p>Maybe around 2016? Early 2017? I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q">Wintergatan&#39;s Marble Machine</a> video and I absolutely fell in love. I spent hours going over Martin&#39;s videos and as a broke high school student, I really wanted to be like him. In that original video, Martin wears a pair of white Juliette SH-7502&#39;s, most likely painted, with original drivers and cable. I did some research and found a pair for just under $25, bought them up and even went out of my way to buy an adapter for my phone at the time. When they arrived, they sounded awful. Just dreadful. And I wore them maybe once before covid. And then I had a night, sometime during that summer, where I put them back on and watched the Wintergatan video again and in a wave of inspiration, set out to make them actually good.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eVs60e6.jpg" alt="my OG black Juiliettes next to the modded beige Juliettes" />

<p>First things first, how did I go about doing that. Well to start, I felt really guilty about pulling a pair of vintage headphones out of the market and I really wanted to have some preservation factor, so I bought another pair. This time for a whole $9. Beige, spider-webbed and somehow even more unusable then the first pair, I cracked them open and ripped the drivers out. I really like the beige look, and I would not be against having an off-white or beige PC case one day (maybe taking an old beige box and making it into a sleeper? future project??). The original 8 Ohm drivers were a little large and really didn&#39;t fit my target specs, so I removed them and went to buy new ones. At the time, I didn&#39;t have a job, so everything was paid for on a hard budget. I decided on some AKG 701 replica drivers for something like $47, and even though these cans weren&#39;t open backs, I felt like they might still work. I was able to reuse the original headband wire and structure, but everything else needed to be gutted. So, to recap, new drivers, new pads (because while I haven&#39;t talked about them, take my word for it they weren&#39;t the pillowy goodness that is 21st century pads), and hell, while we&#39;re at it, a 2.5mm jack to plug in my Audio-Technica M50x&#39;s short cable. This made these great for walking around campus due to their cable, lightness, and (sort of) low bass.</p>
<p>After about two weeks of waiting, I got all of my components and started putting them together. My drivers were just smaller than the original ones, so I had to use strips of cardboard to seat them properly. Even now, a year and a half later, I haven&#39;t glued them down properly. Just cardboard and the back case keeping them in check. Everything soldered together fine, and the female jack went in fine, but it didn&#39;t fit the cable hole. It was actually too wide and too long. I had to make some nasty cuts but the whole thing fit in well, and due to my pad of choice being OEM M50x pads, I simply buffed down the tabs that hold them on and let the mesh in the middle of the pads cover up my negligence to beauty.</p>

<p>And with that, yeah, they&#39;re done. I debated 3d printing some of the parts for this, but I really didn&#39;t want a sort of Theseus&#39;s ship, so all original frame and decently sounding system. I definitely should have been more careful with the drivers, as low bass really kills them, but I really enjoyed doing this. I was sent another pair of 701 drivers by mistake as well as some Beyerdynamic&#39;s (not sure what model they are for though) and I think if I do this again, I will make a whole set from scratch out of ABS. I bought a pair of Lafayette Model F-990&#39;s and I wanted to do this again, but they are truly unmoddable with their literal 100mm+ speaker drivers. Regardless, I really enjoyed this project and this remains one of my favorite projects to date.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

# FloppySiteV3
This is the third iteration of my FloppySite project, a website which serves to host writeups of my projects and act as my portfolio.

To run this site yourself, a build is already provided - thus you should only need to run `npm install -g` and `npm run preview`. 

To add any articles, just add a markdown file under `lib/content` and add a cooresponding entry to the `projects.json` file. 

This website is built with Svelte and Tailwind and contains both previous versions of my website inside, as they were the last time they were updated.
